                <p>Got my first real camera (a Nikon D40) 4 years ago after enjoying to much fiddleing with a small point and shot.
                I am still experimenting and trying to find my style. </p>
                <p>
                Best advice I've ever received:</br>
                 "Canon ? Nikon? Who cares? Buy the camera brand your friends have"</br>
                 "Always shoot raw"</br>
                 "Learn to use manual mode"
                </p>
